/**
 * Weighted recall store, ported from SkillFoundry's memory_bank/ weight system.
 *
 * Each chunk accumulates an explicit relevance weight (default 1.0) that is
 * multiplied into the hybrid search score after vector + BM25 + temporal-decay
 * scoring.  The update rules mirror SkillFoundry's memory_bank conventions:
 *
 *   - Recall  : weight += 0.1  (agent confirmed this memory was useful)
 *   - Correct : original → 0.3, correction entry starts at 0.7
 *
 * Weights are clamped to [MIN_WEIGHT, MAX_WEIGHT] and persisted as a JSON file
 * in the agent's state directory so they survive process restarts.
